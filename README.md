# Notes
Notes app written for Windows

Usage:
./notes.exe new  *Creates a brand new note and burns your last ones if there is an existing NOTES.txt file

./notes.exe add  *adds a new note with timestamp

./notes.exe read * read current notes 

Very fast and uses less memory than any notes application on Windows currently
